**MEETING UPDATES** @everyone
The online events for the next quarter have been decided as the following:

```diff
+ Tuesday Blitz Arena
Blitz games are extremely short, in this case lasting no more than 10 total minutes per game. Arenas are also extremely low-commitment, and any who are interested are free to join and leave whenever they wish.
-   Time Control: 5+0
-   Length:       90 Minutes
-   When:         Tuesdays from 9:00pm-11:30pm

+ Saturdays Rapid Swiss
Rapids are a medium length time format - the average rapid game takes between 10 and 30 minutes. Unlike Arenas, Swiss tournaments have a large time commitment. Anyone interested in joining should stay for the entire duration.
-   Time Control: 10+5
-   Length:       5 rounds (2-2.5 hours with maximum players)
-   When:         Saturdays starting at 5:00pm
```
